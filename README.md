# 10-minute-car-game
My entry for @Brackeys #10minutegame challenge (where I was meant to make a game in 10 minutes). It's a game where you have a car dodging obstacles.
Honesttly, it's a pretty crude game, but you'll be surprised how much effort it took to make it all in 10 minutes. There's typos all over the project: I didn't even have the time to fix those!  Here's a video of me making it: https://youtu.be/h8ytb6MmAvY
